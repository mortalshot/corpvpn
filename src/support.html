                      <p>The best way to prevent unwanted errors is to install a proven, reliable VPN. Premium VPNs are always the best choice as they are reliable, have sophisticated systems and provide access to dedicated customer service teams.</p>
                      <p>Generally, quality VPNs such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, CyberGhost VPN, and SurfShark VPN are an investment. Each of these services has the highest characteristics and an excellent reputation.</p>
                      <p>By choosing one, you will reduce the likelihood of your provider crashing or causing problems.</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>Server change</h4>
                      <p>Changing your server is one of the easiest fixes for a slow or unreliable VPN connection. Some servers are faster than others and this can be due to many reasons.</p>
                      <p>Typically, servers located in physically closer locations can significantly affect connection speed. Certain servers may also become overcrowded with users, slowing down performance.</p>
                      <p>Luckily, most VPN services make it easy to switch servers with extensive networks. Some even have a feature that automatically connects to the best available server.</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>Changing the port</h4>
                      <p>The network port can play an important role in the speed of your connection. If you are experiencing some difficulties, we recommend that you try switching ports.</p>
                      <p>Changing ports can improve your connection, as sometimes ISPs can restrict certain numbers. Sometimes bad connections can be caused by some ports being faster than others.</p>
